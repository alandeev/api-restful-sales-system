## A great project with NodeJS and other techs 🚀
___
## Project experience 📋
> With this project, I understood how the scalable server backend works, I also implemented features that help the system not to break. resource example is Rate Limiter Flexible which implements idea to block many requests in the interval that I define. I also implemented Redis which made the server gain greater performance, saving data on the machine's memory disk, only changing it when necessary.
